                Keeping pace with technological innovation means to constantly update our knowledge. This is why we at AROL have always invested in staff training.            











                For the same reason, we put our know-how at the disposal of our customers, offering training services aimed at training operators and technicians on the machines they use. We can train personnel at their own premises, at AROL or in-line.            











                With this innovative service, AROL intends to prove its willingness to assist customers step by step even after the machine has been sold, offering assistance for personnel and for machines.            











                The training service is held by experts and is specifically prepared on the customer’s needs, taking certain aspects into consideration, e.g. past experience of personnel to be trained, type of use and level of customisation of the machine on which personnel will subsequently work.
